# PARARULE Plus
The new generated dataset for PARARULE. It is generated based on the closed-world assumption.
PARARULE Plus is an improvement on the dataset of PARARULE (Peter Clark, 2020). The motivation is to generate deeper PARARULE training samples. We add more training samples for the case where the depth is greater than or equal to 2 to explore whether Transformer has reasoning ability.

# Data distribution


# Example
## An example with the non-negation rules for Depth=2 means the question needed to be derived by two rules.
